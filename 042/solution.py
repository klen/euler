    u""" Solve the problem.

    The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1);
    so the first ten triangle numbers are:

    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

    By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
    alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value.
    For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word
    value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

    Using words.txt, a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common
    English words, how many are triangle words?
